GDPR and third-party and M&A activities

GDPR impact has been dissected and examined to death - however, M&A activities, as well as third-party security posture, can be greatly affected as well, and this aspect has not been very often pursued. This session hopes to be useful for that.

In this repository you will find the material I presented in the ISACA Cyber Security Nexus (CSX) Europe 2018 conference:

I hope they are useful to you and your business.

Enjoy!
